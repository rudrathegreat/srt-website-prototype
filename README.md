# Swinburne Rover Team Website High Fidelity Prototype
This code here provides a proof-of-concept of what the MVP website should look like.

It is important to note however, that this website is only a proof-of-concept, and that the final website's backend will use React and Material UI, something that has not been addressed in the proof of concept.
